RGB Color Slider Project
This project is a simple RGB color slider created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interactively generate RGB color codes by adjusting the values of the Red, Green, and Blue sliders. The generated color code is displayed in real-time, and users can also copy it to their clipboard with the click of a button.
